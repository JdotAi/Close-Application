# Close-Application
Close an Application Automatically
If you ever need to close an application at a particular time this code will ask for the application name and the time you want to close it.
And it will automatically close the app for you. (*Cough Cough If you fall asleep during a Zoom meeting set the time to leave the meeting to not be embarrassed*)
